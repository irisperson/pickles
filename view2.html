		<h2> It's nice to meet you. ðŸ˜Š </h2>
		<p> My full name is Alphonse Pickles Wu. It's a quirky name, I know. My dad named me Alphonse because his name is Alfred and he wanted me to have a name that started with an "A" too. I guess he also wants me to get straight A's in school in the future. Pickles is my middle name, but everyone prefers to call me that instead. Pickles was taken from that '90s (waaaay before I was born) cartoon show <i> The Rugrats </i> whose main character (tommy)'s surname was Pickles. It has some sentimental meaning for Dad.
		 </p>

		 <p> I was born on October 3, 2014. I am currently 3 years old, but in my video and profile picture, I am only about 1 years old. Everyday I am told by my family that I "grow up too fast." I can walk, run, jump, and talk perfectly well. Grandpa likes to call me a little naughty kid because I jump on things I'm not supposed to and I draw on the walls.</p>

		 <p> My hobbies include eating candy, stealing candy from high shelves adults think I can't find a way to reach, begging the nearest grown-up to buy me ice cream (in secret of course, because Dad doesn't allow it), going to the park, attending preschool, eating the pepperoni off pizzas, and spreading joy. I'm a perfect angel, I know. I'm cute and I say the darnest things. I can speak three languages: Mandarin, Cantonese, and Chinglish. My first languages were Mandarin and Cantonese, so I didn't start learning my ABCs until about six months ago. Now my fluent English phrases are: "Don't do that!" and "Oh my god!" because I hear these frequently from my teachers. </p>
